## About This Repository

This repository documents the structured design, analysis, and implementation of mechatronics systems developed as part of a focused engineering growth program.

Projects emphasize:

- Controls Engineering  
- Embedded Systems & Firmware  
- Power Electronics & Motor Control  
- Mechanical Design & Load Analysis  
- System Architecture & Verification  
- Industrial Communication Protocols (Modbus, EtherCAT – planned)  
- Data Analysis & Validation (MATLAB / Python)  

All projects follow a formal engineering workflow:

1. System Definition  
2. Performance Derivation  
3. Architecture Design  
4. Requirements Tracking  
5. Verification Planning  
6. Risk & Margin Analysis  
7. Implementation & Testing
